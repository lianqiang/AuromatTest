It took a while since the last release but it was worth the waiting time. In the last 12 months we nearly added and tweaked __160 lens profiles__! 

Further work was spent on:

* Streamlined lens names for better auto-detection
* Command line tools to update the local database and to manage mount compatibilities
* Higher accuracy for fisheye <--> rectinilear transformation for lenses with
  real focal length data
* Many bugfixes, especially for the case if sensor sizes of calibration and
  image to-be-corrected are different
* Removed the old proprietary python based build system as it was not maintained anymore 

A detailed overview of all changes can be found in the [Changelog for 0.3.0]({% post_url /changelogs/2014-09-30-Release-0.3.0-Changelog %}).
