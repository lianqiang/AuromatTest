The new Lensfun 0.3.2 release is out with more than  __50 new__ lens profiles and another __19 updated__ calibrations.

Most important changes are in the build system. The preferred way to set install paths is now to use the CMAKE_INSTALL_XXX variables from the [GNUInstallDirs module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/GNUInstallDirs.html). Furthermore, the library binary version number was incremented to fix various compatibility and packaging problems. 

Other changes:

* Improved vignetting interpolation
* Internal code cleanups
* New LENSFUN_WINDOWS_DATADIR CMake variable for better windows compatibility
* Support for parallel installation of different database versions
